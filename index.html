                <p>" I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have head some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for teh free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "</p>

                <p>" The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and preseny myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. "</p>

                <p>" Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs whi can only say wonderdful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. There were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, i particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that bo tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "</p>
